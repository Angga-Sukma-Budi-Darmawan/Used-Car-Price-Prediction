# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction and Analysis

## ✨ Background

An online platform specializing in used car sales aims to enhance its **pricing strategy**. Developing a **data-driven price prediction model** can lead to **standardized pricing**, increased transparency, and empower both buyers and sellers with **informed decision-making**. This project focuses on building a **machine learning regression model** and analyzing pricing behavior within the used car market on the platform, utilizing techniques such as **XGBoost Regressor** and other relevant modeling approaches.

## 🤔 Problem Statement

How can we build a **machine learning model** to **accurately predict the price of a used car**, thereby enabling **better pricing strategies** and potentially **maximizing profitability**?

---

## 🎯 Goals

The project aims to achieve two primary goals:

* 💰 **Build a machine learning model to predict used car prices** with the potential to **increase company revenue**.
* 🔑 **Identify the key factors that significantly influence used car prices**.

## ⚙️ Analytical Approach

The project follows these key steps:

* 🔍 **Data Understanding:** Conduct initial analysis to gain a thorough understanding of the dataset's **structure, content, and characteristics**.
* ✨ **Data Cleaning:** Perform necessary preprocessing, including handling **anomalies/outliers** and **imputing missing values**.
* 🛠️ **Feature Engineering:** Develop or transform features to improve the **predictive performance** of the models.
* 📈 **Baseline Model Development:** Implement and evaluate a range of **regression models** as baselines using chosen evaluation metrics.
* 🧪 **Model Tuning & Selection:** Optimize the **hyperparameters** of the baseline models and compare their **performance** to select the most promising one.
* 💪 **Model Improvement:** Further enhance the selected best model through iterative **feature engineering and fine-tuning**.
* ✅ **Final Model Validation:** Evaluate the **performance** of the improved model and designate it as the final model if the enhancements are substantial.
* 📊 **Business Impact Evaluation:** Compare the final machine learning model's **results** against a **rule-based pricing strategy** to assess its potential for **revenue improvement** based on prediction error.

## 📉 Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance will be evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
* **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
* **R-squared (R²)**

## 💾 Data Understanding

**Data Source**
The dataset was scraped from Kaggle and is provided in **.csv** (Comma-Separated Values) format. It comprises **5624 rows** and **numerous columns**, detailing **key car attributes** such as model, region, brand, transmission type, and origin, indicating if the price is negotiable, and providing **quantitative metrics** like manufacturing year, engine capacity, mileage, and price in Saudi riyals.
